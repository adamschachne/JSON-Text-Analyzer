These data files are of ASCII format and include Seismic Shot Point Navigation data that provide the primary seismic navigation source for this cruise. Data were acquired as part of the project: Hi-Res MCS, CHIRP and side-scan sonar study of NY/NJ margins, and funding was provided by NSF grants: OCE01-19019 and OCE02-24767. These data are cited by McHugh et al., 2010.",

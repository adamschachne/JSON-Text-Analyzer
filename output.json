    "abstract": " Incorporating a flow pump into a conventional triaxial laboratory system allows fluid to be supplied to or withdrawn from the base of a sediment sample at small and constant rates. An initial transient record of hydraulic head versus time is observed which eventually stabilizes to a constant steady state gradient across the sample; values of hydraulic conductivity can subsequently be determined from Darcy\u0027s law. In this paper, analytical methods are presented for determining values of specific storage and hydraulic conductivity from the initial transient phase of such a constant flow rate test. These methods are based on a diffusion equation involving pore pressure and are analogous to those used to describe the soil consolidation process and also to interpret aquifer properties from pumping tests.",

    "abstract": "Tests were performed to investigate the geometric characteristics of Landsat 4 images. The first set of tests was designed to determine the extent of image distortion caused by the physical process of writing the Landsat 4 images on film. The second was designed to characterize the geometric accuracies inherent in the digital images themselves. Test materials consisted of film images of test targets generated by the Laser Beam Recorders at Sioux Falls, the Optronics* Photowrite film writer at Goddard Space Flight Center, and digital image files of a strip 600 lines deep across the full width of band 5 of the Washington, D. C. Thematic Mapper scene. The tests were made by least-squares adjustment of an array of measured image points to a corresponding array of control points.",

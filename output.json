    "abstract": "The Real-Time Soil Moisture Monitoring Network provides integrated observation of water, energy and temperature in the soils of the Shale Hills Susquehanna Critical Zone Observatory watershed.  Electric Conductivity is measured at between 4 and 5 depths at 13 sites. Electric conductivity is measured with HydraProbes manufactured by Stevens Instruments, and by 5TE probes manufactured by Decagon. At 2 sites (15 and 55) electric conductivity is measured with 2 loggers, which have different time stamps. Where offsets are the same, left precedes right. CITATION:  PUBLICATIONS: 1.

    "abstract": "This is project presents data related to discharge measurements from the Bisley Watershed in the Luquillo Mountains.Long-term rainfall and discharge data from the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) were analysed to develop relationships between rainfall, stream-runoff, and elevation. These relationships were then used with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to determine spatially-averaged, mean annual hydrologic budgets for watersheds and forest types within the study area. Model estimates indicate that a total of 3864 mm/yy (444 hm3) of rainfall falls on the forest in an average year. The Tabonuco, Colorado, Palm and Dwarf Forest types receive an estimated annual rainfall of 3537, 4191, 4167, and 4849 mm/yy, respectively. Of the average annual rainfall input, 65% (2526 mm/yr) is converted to runoff and the remainding 35% (1338 mm.yr) is lost from the system by evapotranspiration and other abstractions. In comparison to other tropical forests, the LEF as a whole has more evapotranspiration than many tropical montane forests but less evapotranspiration than many lowland tropical forests.; PUBLICATIONS: DEFAULT_PARAMTER.UTCOffset \u003d -4DEFAULT_PARAMETER.TimeZone \u003d ASTDEFAULT_PARAMETER.DataBeginsOnRow \u003d 5DEFAULT_PARAMETER.NoDataValue \u003d-6999DEFAULT_PARAMETER.QualityControlLevel \u003d 2DEFAULT_PARAMETER.sitecode \u003d 20DEFAULT_PARAMETER.timeSupport \u003dDEFAULT_PARAMETER.timeSupportUnits \u003dDEFAULT_PARAMETER.DataFile \u003d Q1_5m5-6-11to2-22-12.csv",

The probe was carried along the contour of the slope and recorded georeferenced measurements of specific conductance every one to two seconds. These measurements were started in November of 2014 and continued to be made every two months for a year after (November 2014 â?? September 2015) by Caitlin Hodges. EMI provides information on soil specific conductance, which can then be used to infer soil moisture and texture conditions. When repeated measurements are made, soil moisture changes over time can be observed. This raw data is best utilized by importing into ArcMap and interpolating the specific conductivity measurements to generate a 2D map of soil conductivity. Hodges used the data to inform her installation of her rusted steel redox indicators in the watersheds to assess soil redox potential in the watersheds (first deployment, October 2015). \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\t\nDATE RANGE COMMENTS: Measurements made every 2 months",

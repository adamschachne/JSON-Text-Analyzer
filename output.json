These data files are of Sippican MK21 Export Data File format and include Sound Velocity and Temperature data that have not been processed. Data were acquired as part of the project(s): Collaborative Research: Seismic measurements of magma flux, arc composition, and lower-plate serpentinization in the Central American subduction factory and TICO-CAVA, 2008 Leg 2, and funding was provided by NSF grant(s): OCE04-05556, OCE04-05572, OCE04-05608, OCE04-05654, OCE05-20378, and OCE06-25178.",
